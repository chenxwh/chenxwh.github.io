Hi! I am Chenxi, a Research Scientist at **Meta** FAIR, focusing on Fundamental AI Research for LLMs. I work with **[Jason Weston](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lMkTx0EAAAAJ&hl=en)** in the FAIR Alignment team on post-training and reasoning, leading projects in Reinforcement Learning, LLM-as-a-Judge, and Reward Modeling. I also collaborate with the Llama post-training team to integrate these foundational advances into core models.

Alongside my industry role, I am a visiting researcher at the **[University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/about)**, where I was previously a postdoctoral research associate collaborating with **[Prof. Andreas Vlachos](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/av308)** on factuality in NLP. My academic background includes a PhD in knowledge-grounded NLP from **[City, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/)** and a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from the **[University of Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.fau.eu/)** and **[University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/)**.

My current **Research Interests** include:

* Post-training and Reinforcement Learning and Large-Scale Reasoning Models
* [LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10320) and [Generative Reward Modeling](/assets/pdf/papers/LM_as_RM.pdf)
* [AI Co-Scientist](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23707) and Co-Improvement
