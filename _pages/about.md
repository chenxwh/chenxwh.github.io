I am Chenxi, currently an applied research scientist at [Amazon AGI Cambridge](https://www.amazon.science/locations/london-and-cambridge), working on advancing Large Language Models (LLMs). I am also a visiting researcher at [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/about), where I previously worked as a postdoctoral research associate, collaborating with [Prof Andreas Vlachos](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/av308) on automated fact-checking.

I completed my PhD in knowledge-grounded NLP at [City, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/). Before that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Information Engineering from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), and my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from [University of Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg](https://www.fau.eu/) and [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).

My research focuses on Natural Language Understanding and Generation, Multilinguality, Knowledge Distillation, and Reasoning. During my PhD, I interned at [Google DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/) in Amsterdam, [Amazon Alexa AI](https://amazon.jobs/en-gb/landing_pages/Cambridge) in Cambridge, [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://noahlab.com.hk/) in London, and visited [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) as a research assistant.

I am also part of the machine learning engineering team at [Replicate](https://replicate.com/), working towards open-source AI solutions.
