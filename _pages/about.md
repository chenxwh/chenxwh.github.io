I am Chenxi, a final-year PhD student at the computer science department of [City, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/), working on NLP supervised by [Dr Tillman Weyde](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/people/academics/tillman-weyde) and [Dr Pranava Madhyastha](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/people/academics/pranava-madhyastha).
I received my Bachelor's degree in Information Engineering at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), and my Master's 
degree in Electrical Engineering at [University of Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg](https://www.fau.eu/) and [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).

My research focuses on Natural Language Understanding and Generation, and Multimodal Learning with Knowledge and Reasoning.
During my PhD I interned at [Google DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/) in Amsterdam (hosted by [Jasmijn Bastings](https://jasmijn.ninja/), [Fantine Huot](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=79VvQLMAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Mirella Lapata](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j67B9Q4AAAAJ&hl=en)), [Amazon Alexa AI](https://amazon.jobs/en-gb/landing_pages/Cambridge) in Cambridge, [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://noahlab.com.hk/) in London, and visited [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) as a research assistant.
In my most recent projects I have also explored parameter efficient modelling (LoRA) and diffusion language models.

I am expected to finish my PhD later this year and will be joining [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/about) as a postdoc researcher working with [Prof Andreas Vlachos](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/av308).
