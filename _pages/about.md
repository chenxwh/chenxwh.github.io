Hi! I am Chenxi, a Research Scientist at **Meta**, focusing on Fundamental AI Research for LLMs. I work closely with [Jason Weston](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lMkTx0EAAAAJ&hl=en) in the FAIR Alignment team on post-training and reasoning, leading projects in Reinforcement Learning, LLM-as-a-Judge, and Reward Modeling. I also collaborate with the Llama post-training team to integrate these foundational advances into core models.

Alongside my industry role, I am a visiting researcher at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/about), where I was previously a postdoctoral research associate collaborating with [Prof. Andreas Vlachos](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/av308) on factuality in NLP. My academic background includes a PhD in knowledge-grounded NLP from [City, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/) and a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.fau.eu/) and [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).

My current **research interests** include:

* Large-Scale Reasoning Models
* Post-training and Reinforcement Learning
* LLM-as-a-Judge and Generative Reward Modeling

I am actively exploring **Senior Research Scientist** roles in industry. If you have an opening and believe my profile is a good fit, I'd be happy to connect!
