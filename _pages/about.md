I am Chenxi, a PhD student at the computer science department of [City, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/) supervised by Dr Tillman Weyde and [Dr Pranava Madhyastha](https://pmadhyastha.github.io/).
I received my Bachelor's degree in Information Engineering at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), and my Master's 
degree in Electrical Engineering at [University of Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg](https://www.fau.eu/) and [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).

My current research focuses on Natural Language Understanding and Generation, and Multimodal Learning with Knowledge and Reasoning.
During my PhD I have worked as a research scientist intern at [Amazon Alexa AI](https://amazon.jobs/en-gb/landing_pages/Cambridge) in Cambridge, and [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://noahlab.com.hk/) in London.
I also visited [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) as research assistant and will be joining [Google DeepMind](https://research.google/locations/amsterdam/) in Amsterdam as a research scientist intern this summer.
