I am Chenxi, a postdoc researcher at [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/about) working with [Prof Andreas Vlachos](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/av308) on automated fact-checking.
I pursued my PhD studies on knowledge-grounded NLP at [City, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/).
Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Information Engineering at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), and my Master's 
degree in Electrical Engineering at [University of Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg](https://www.fau.eu/) and [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).

My research focuses on Natural Language Understanding and Generation, Multilinguality, with Knowledge and Reasoning.
During my PhD, I interned at [Google DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/) in Amsterdam, [Amazon Alexa AI](https://amazon.jobs/en-gb/landing_pages/Cambridge) in Cambridge, [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://noahlab.com.hk/) in London, and visited [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) as a research assistant.
In my most recent projects I have also explored parameter efficient modelling (LoRA) and diffusion language models.

I am also part of the machine learning engineering team at [Replicate](https://replicate.com/), working towards open-source AI solutions.
