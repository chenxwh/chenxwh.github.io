Two works that I led at Meta are accepted in [ICLR 2026](https://iclr.cc/)! 
- [J1: Incentivizing Thinking in LLM-as-a-Judge via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10320)
- [MENLO: From Preferences to Proficiency -- Evaluating and Modeling Native-like Quality Across 47 Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26601)!
